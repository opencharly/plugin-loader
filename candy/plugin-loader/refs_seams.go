// refs_seams.go — the loader plugin's remote-repo fetch entry points (K-wave 2 cone R1).
//
// These legs used to be spec.RefsCollectSeams built by charly core: core resolved each one against
// the provider registry and threaded the struct down into the relocated mechanism. That put core in
// the middle of every fetch for no reason the boundary law recognises — core was not DEFINING a
// mechanism there, only CALLING three providers and reading one env var on the loader's behalf, and
// the defines-vs-calls test says that is an R-item.
//
// A2 finished the move: the BUILDER itself now lives in sdk/loaderkit
// (loaderkit.RefsSeamsFromContext, refs_seams_executor.go) as the ONE copy, because
// candy/plugin-build needs the identical value to drive EnsureRepoDownloaded /
// CollectRemoteRefsOpts itself instead of round-tripping through charly's now-deleted
// `buildengine-ensure-repo` / `buildengine-collect-remote-refs` host legs. A second private copy
// here would be exactly the R3 duplicate this program removes.

// refsSeams builds the fetch legs for one call, delegating to the shared loaderkit builder.
